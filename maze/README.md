This whole maze thing is pretty derivative, based off of an algorithm described at http://jamisbuck.org/mazes (recursive backtracking). 
I started out wanting to make the dungeon from [hauberk][1] (which I have! It's `roomsmazes.py`, but it's still really slow), but it progressed into an obsession with just making mazes, with any algorithm I can get my hands on.
