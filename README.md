# Some Python Stuff
It's really just a place to put everything when I play around in python  

The maze thing is pretty derivative, based off of an algorithm described at http://jamisbuck.org/mazes (recursive backtracking)  
I started out wanting to make the dungeon from [hauberk][1], but it progressed into an obsession with just making mazes, with any algorithm I can get my hands on (I'm kinda dumb so it took forever)
